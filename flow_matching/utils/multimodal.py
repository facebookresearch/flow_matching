class Flow(nn.Module):
    """
    Generic multimodal flow matching model.

    This class aggregates multiple modalities, each with its own model, path,
    scheduler, and loss. It provides utilities for training (computing the total
    loss) and inference (sampling) across all modalities.

    Args:
        model (nn.Module):
            A model that receives a sequence of state tensors
            (one per modality) as ``x`` and a scalar time tensor ``t``,
            and returns a sequence of output tensors. For continuous modalities,
            the output is a velocity. For discrete modalities, it is the
            posterior probability `p_1t`.
        modalities (Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]):
            Mapping from modality name to a dict with keys:
                - "path": A probability path object (e.g., MixtureDiscreteProbPath for discrete data,
                or any continuous path implementation).
                - "loss" (optional): A callable loss function. If omitted, a default loss is chosen
                based on the path type.
                - "weight" (optional): A float weight for the modality's training loss. Defaults to 1.0.
                - "x_1_prediction" (continuous paths only, optional): If True, the model is expected to predict
                the clean data `x_1` for that modality, and such predictions will be reparameterized
                as velocities during the sampling process. If False, the model is expected to predict
                the velocities directly. Defaults to False.
        model_sampling_fn (str, optional): If ``model`` is a class instance
            with multiple methods, this specifies the method to use for
            forward passes during sampling. Defaults to ``"forward"``.
